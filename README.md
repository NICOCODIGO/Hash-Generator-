# Hashing Word Generator 

Hello! In this project of mine, I have built this local web to continue learning and understanding JavaScript, CSS & HTML. It has two parts: 

1) A  **Matrix-style** green animation drawn on an HTML5 `<canvas>`.
2) A **Hash Generator** that the user can input with any text and the output would be turned into MD5 / SHA-1 / SHA-256 / SHA-512 hex

No server, or data access like that, just a project that runs in the local browser 

## ðŸŽ¯ Why I built this

I've always been fascinated by the cybersecurity concept and fascinated on how hashing works in practice! But I also wanted to understand how canvas animation worked, how to use the Web Crypto API, and the basic Buttons, key events, inputs

and so this project will let me try all that at once

## HOW IT WORKS:

- Canvas will use random characters to be flashed with the color green and to make it rain after
- since the MD5 is outdated it will be done by **CryptoJS**

----------
To try it, simply Download/Clone repo and open `index.html` in a browser

after that, type anything and see how hashing will turn your text into random hex!

Thanks for checking this out! Feedback and tips for beginner like me are welcome!
